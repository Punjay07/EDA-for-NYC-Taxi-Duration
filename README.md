Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to identify underlying patterns in the data, draw inferences, and even act as the foundation for feature engineering before we begin creating our model.
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of studying data and extracting insights from it in order to examine its major properties. EDA can be accomplished through the use of statistics and graphical approaches.

Why is EDA important?
We simply cannot make sense of such massive datasets unless we investigate the data.
Exploring and analysing the data is essential for determining how features contribute to the target variable, identifying anomalies and outliers and treating them so that they do not affect our model, studying the nature of the features, and being able to perform data cleaning so that our model building process is as efficient as possible.
We won't be able to uncover inconsistent or incomplete data that may pose trends wrongly to our model unless we conduct exploratory data analysis.
From a business standpoint, corporate stakeholders frequently make assumptions about data. Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to go deeper and see whether our intuition fits the data. It allows us to determine whether or not we are asking the appropriate questions.

This stage also acts as the foundation for responding to our business queries.


We will use libraries like: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.
